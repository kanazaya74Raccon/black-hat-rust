## Summary

Whether it be in movies or in mainstream media, hackers are often romanticized: they are painted as black magic wizards, nasty criminals, or, in the worst cases, as thieves with a hood and a crowbar.
In reality, the spectrum of the profile of the attackers is extremely large, from the bored teenager exploring the internet to sovereign Stateâ€™s armies as well as the unhappy former employee.

What are the motivations of the attackers? How can they break seemingly so easily into any network? What do they do to their victims?
We will put on our black hat and explore the arcanes of offensive security, whether it be cyber attacks, cybercrimes or cyberwar.
Scanners, exploits, malwares... From theory to practice, we will explore the arcanes of offensive security and build our own offensive tools with the Rust programming language, Stack Overflowâ€™s most loved language for five years in a row.

Rust is opening a new page in history of programming languages by providing unmatched guarantees and features, whether it be in defensive or, as we will see, offensive security.

Free Updates and DRM Free, of course :)

## Who this book is for

This is NOT a 1000th tutorial about sqlmap and Metasploit.

You will enjoy it if any of the following:

- You keep screaming "show me the code!" when reading about cyber attacks and malwares
- You want to learn real-world and idiomatic rust practices
- You want to make money with bug bounties or offensive security
- You believe that the best defense is thinking like an attacker
- You learn by building and love to look under the hood
- You develop your own tools and exploits with Python, Ruby, C, Java...
- You want to learn real-world offensive security, not just pentesting
